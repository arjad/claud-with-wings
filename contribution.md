# Contribution Guide

Welcome! We appreciate your interest in contributing to this repository. Below are the guidelines to help you get started with contributing.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Create an Issue
Before making any contributions, ensure that an issue exists for the work you plan to do. If an issue doesn't exist, please create one first. Clearly describe the problem, feature request, or improvement you want to address.

- **For Bugs**: Describe the bug, steps to reproduce it, and the expected behavior.
- **For Features**: Explain the feature you want to add and its benefits.
- **For Improvements**: Suggest how the current code or functionality can be improved.

### 2. Branch Naming Convention
When creating a branch for your work, follow this format:

- **Type**: Can be `feature`, `bug`, or `improvement`.
- **Issue Number**: The issue number from the issue tracker (e.g., `#123`).
- **Short Description**: A brief description of the work done (use hyphens instead of spaces).

#### Examples:
- `feature-123-add-user-authentication`
- `bug-456-fix-login-error`
- `improvement-789-optimize-database-query`

### 3. Create a Pull Request (PR)
Once your work is complete, create a pull request (PR) from your branch to the `main` branch. Ensure the following:

- Reference the issue number in the PR description (e.g., `Fixes #123`).
- Provide a clear and concise description of the changes made.
- Ensure your code follows the project's coding standards and passes all tests.
